This component is made of 3 parts:
- Local Temperature
  The player's temperature.

- Global Temperature
  The base outside temperature without any influence from a zone (e.g. campfire) in CÂ°

- Temperature Offset
  When player enters a Collision2D zone (e.g. Campfire), the temperature offset will be added to the global temperature


- Fixed Temperature
  The base temperature inside a structure (e.g. cabin) where it is not influenced by the Global Temperature
